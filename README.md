# Hospital-Management-System
DNA Project
## Overview: 

We all have gone to a hospital/clinic at some point in our lives. Their significance cannot be overstated. Thus, the following database structure serves to make it easier for both patients as well as doctors/administration to navigate through the hospital environment. 

The resulting system can keep track of doctor appointments and surgeries enabling both patients to ascertain which doctors are free as well as doctors to keep track of their schedule. The system can also be used to check the availability of rooms such as a ward, operation theatre, etc., to keep track of bills, to maintain an inventory of medicines in the pharmacy and many more applications. Overall, it will automate the entire functioning making it faster, easier and more efficient to use.
